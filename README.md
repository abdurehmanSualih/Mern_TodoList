MERN Todo List

A full-stack Todo List application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) todos, with a responsive frontend styled using Tailwind CSS and a backend powered by MongoDB.

View Todos: Display a list of all todos with completion status.



Edit Todos: Update the text of existing todos.



Toggle Completion: Mark todos as completed or incomplete (frontend-only for now).



Delete Todos: Remove todos from the list.



Responsive Design: Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS.



Error Handling: Displays errors (e.g., "Text field is required") in a user-friendly alert.



Error Boundary: Prevents app crashes by showing a fallback UI for runtime errors.
